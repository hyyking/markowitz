# PyMarkowitz

## Purpose

Provide utility to create visually appealing and customisable graphic representation of markowitz's
modern portfolio theory.

## Usage

For this you will need two files:

- A layout file (see below)

- A SQLite database or a list of CSV files, specify the loader with `-l` flag with historical data,
  specify the header you want to load by providing an argument to `-c`.

You can use this package as a CLI:

```
>> python -m markowitz --help

usage: PyMarkowitz [options] LAYOUT INPUT [INPUT...]

Display Assets and Portfolio Graphs from Layout Files

positional arguments:
  layout                layout file path
  input                 data input file(s)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l LOADER, --loader LOADER
                        loader (default: sqlite)
  -c COLUMN, --column COLUMN
                        name of the header (default: clot)
  --debug               activate debug mode
  --style STYLE         matplotlib graph style
```

Or as individual modules:

- `markowitz/graphs` for graph points generators
- `markowitz/sets` for point generators
- `markowitz/financial` for the assets

## Layout Files

Syntax:

```
!						<- comment marker
&						<- start of a new window
(KEY=VALUE)				<- specify options
[]						<- row
|						<- column delimiter
& NAME (OPTIONS) {[|]}  <- valid window
```

Example:

```
! Compare the distribution of two assets
& Compare (precision=100, scale=100) {
	[ Kde(asset1) Kde(asset2) ]
	[ NormalGraph(asset1) | NormalGraph(asset2) ]
}
```

## Extending the capabilities

You can extend the available graphs and sets by adding them in the `markowitz/graphs` and
`markowitz/sets` directories.

- **Sets** are mathematical vector space point iterators. To implement one you need to subclass
  `markowitz/sets/abstract.py` which will force you to write a valid point iterator.

- **Graphs** are point iterators that map one set (hence `markowitz/sets`) to a set of points that
  can be graphed. To implement one you need to subclass `markowitz/graphs/abstract.py` which will
  force you to write a `points()` method which is called when generating the graph, make sure to zip
  the coordinates together, eg. `zip(x, y)`. Graphs are loaded dynamically at runtime, use your
  implementation by mentioning the class name in the layout file, and name your implementation file
  the same way but **_lowercase_**. The abstract class holds the default config for a graph, you can
  override this config and the config passed when parsing layout files in your implementation.

- **Loader** holds the state of the assets and how they will be loaded, you can implement you own by
  following the already existing ones.

## To be done

- Add better logging
- Add unittests
- Generate documentation
- Split github.io website in two parts: project and documentation
- Add package to pypy
- Add ability to specify other graph obj directory
